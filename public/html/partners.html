            <p>The Geological Survey of Canada, a part of the Earth Science Sector of the Ministry of Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) is Canada’s premier agency for geoscientific information and research, with world-class expertise focusing on geoscience surveys, sustainable development of Canada’s resources, environmental protection, and technology innovation.The Gas Hydrates program of the NRCan is working with many national and international partners to quantify the distribution and properties of Canada’s marine and terrestrial gas hydrates. NRCan experts are also contributing to improving gas hydrate exploration techniques and to finding economically viable and environmentally responsible extraction and production methods. The program is also assessing the possible environmental issues posed by gas hydrates and associated geohazards.</p>

            <p>The main aim of GANS is to quantify gas accumulations in the 1) form of hydrates in sediments on the Norway - Barents Sea - Svalbard (NBS) margin; including an assessment of their dynamics and impacts on the seabed, and 2) their response on sediments and biota, to provide knowledge vital for a safe exploitation in oil and gas production. The overall objective is to make a coordinated effort on a national level to achieve the main objective by the following sub-goals:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Geophysical characterization of gas hydrates</li>
              <li>Geological and geochemical setting of gas hydrate reservoirs and seeps</li>

            <p>The mass of organic carbon in sedimentary basins amounts to a staggering 1016 tons, dwarfing the mass contained in coal, oil, gas and all living systems by ten thousand-fold. The changing fate of this giant mass during subsidence and uplift, via chemical, physical and biological processes, is known to ultimately control fossil energy resource occurrence worldwide. But what has been overlooked and/or ignored until now is its enormous capacity for driving global climate: only a tiny degree of leakage, particularly when focussed through the clathrate cycle, can result in high greenhouse gas emissions, both in the present as well as in the geologic past.<br/><br/>Understanding the workings of sedimentary basins in time and space is fundamental to gaining insights into Earth’s climate.</p>

            <p>The Leibniz Institute of Marine Sciences at the University of Kiel (IFM-GEOMAR) was founded in January 2004 through the merger of the Institut für Meereskunde (IfM) and the Research Center for Marine Geosciences (GEOMAR). The institute is a member of the Leibniz-foundation and employs approximately 500 scientific and technical staff. The institutes’ mandate is the interdisciplinary investigation of all relevant aspects of modern marine sciences, from seafloor geology to marine meteorology. Research is conducted worldwide in all oceans. The institute has four major research divisions: ocean circulation and climate dynamics, marine biogeochemistry, marine ecology and the dynamics of the ocean floor.<br/>
            The Leibniz Institute of Marine Sciences is associated with the University of Kiel in undergraduate and graduate teaching in the following fields: oceanography, meteorology, biological oceanography, fisheries biology, marine chemistry and geology. Basic research on marine gas hydrates has a long tradition at IFM-GEOMAR. Recently a new national program on applied gas hydrate research has been launched at the institute to develop environmentally acceptable technologies for gas hydrate exploitation.</p>

            <p>Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources (KIGAM) was established in 1918, and prolongated its central roles in comprehensive mineral exploration and energy development as the government supported research institute. For the last century, KIGAM strives to achieve the core technology, which mobilizes national competitiveness and endless productivity. KIGAM accomplishes national projects to enhance the quality of our daily lives by improving safety levels, educating cautions of natural disasters, and developing new materials and energy sources. KIGAM covers various fields of geological research in nationwide and overseas such as gas hydrate, mineral exploration, groundwater flow research, usage of underground space, and efficient utilization of national territory. More so, KIGAM endeavors to develop the prominent unchallenged technologies in geological disasters such as earthquakes and landslides, as well as global climate change mitigations on CO2 geological storage, mineral carbonations, and waste disposals.</p>
